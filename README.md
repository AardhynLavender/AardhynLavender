### _Howdy!_

_I'm a computer science and programming enthusiast with a passion for web-based and native software engineering and the fundamentals of game development, programming, and design. I'm right at home in **C/C++**, **C#**, **Typescript** and more. I Use **Vim** and emulators for Vim in **Visual Studio Code**, and **CLion**._

I'm at present studying my second year of the **Bachelor of Information Technology** at Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand. This semester we're covering web-based software and API development, relational database design though to construction, and operating system concepts and engineering.

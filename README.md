### _Howdy!_

I'm a computer science and programming enthusiast with a passion for web and native software engineering and the fundamentals of game programming and design. At present studying my second year of the Bachelor of Information Technology at Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand.

This past semester we've covered web-based software and API development, relational database design though to construction, and operating system concepts and scripting.

I'm right at home in languages including C/C++, C#, and TypeScript. I Use Visual Studio for an IDE, and Visual Studio Code with Vim for text editing. I work on Windows 11 (primarily), MacOS, and Linux based systems.
